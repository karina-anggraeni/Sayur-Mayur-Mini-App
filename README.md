This is a small assignment project I did with my amazing friend and partner Mega Alam (you could check out her LinkedIn profile [here](https://id.linkedin.com/in/mega-alam-777448164)) when we were students at Purwadhika.
The purpose of this assignment is to help us apply **CRUD** (Create, Read, Update, Delete) logic to manipulate data stored inside a **list**.

You can see the full code in the **SayurMayur_CRUD** file.

This is a small assignment project I did with my amazing friend and partner Mega Alam (you could check out her LinkedIn profile !(here)(https://id.linkedin.com/in/mega-alam-777448164)) when we were students at Purwadhika.
The purpose of this assignment is to help us practice using **list** as a place to store data while also applying **CRUD** (Create, Read, Update, Delete) to manipulate data.
